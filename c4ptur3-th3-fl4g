It’s very simple flag anyone can guess, how let look over first word which is .

Number to word cheat sheet :

1 = f
2 = r
3 = e
4 = a
7 = t
g = 9
0 = o

This’s a last challenge of Translation & Shifting.
To solve this You need to follow my each steps:

Firstly, look for any clues from the given encoded data.
Yes, we got an clue which’s “=” at the end of this data ok this sign indicating that this data encoded in base64.
So first of all copy this data and search of an base64 decoding tool or say ref. RapidTables
It’s will give the data in “—– .—-” again! it’s an type of encoded still need to do more hardwork over this data.

Look for second clue from this above decoded data any you fails to find any clue, I’ll help you just copy this data and navigate for an website called “cyber chef” simply put this data into input field and drag an module of “From Morse Code” from left panel from Encoding & Encryption section!

Hurry! we’ve got binary data! from here no help needed I thought but not that when you decode this binary in decorder such as “Rapidtable” where you’ll find again data in encoded form but no worries!

I’ve solution for this just copy this because this type of data looks like as “Rot47” so put this in “Cryptii” & navigate Rot47 section in middle!
It’ll generate this data into “Decimal form” simply put decimal data in this in “RapidTables“

hurray! you got the solution!!!!!

[Task 2] Hashes
#1 A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size onto data of a fixed size. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hashcodes, digests, or simply hashes. Crack the following hashes to reveal the answers. Hashcat  bruteforce is probably the easiest way to complete this challenge, or try CyberChef and md5hasing.net if you want to go easy-mode. Reference this website for known hash types

[Task 3] Spectrograms
#1 A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. When applied to an audio signal, spectrograms are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams. When the data is represented in a 3D plot they may be called waterfalls.
